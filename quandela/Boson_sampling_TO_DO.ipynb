    "Sampling is the problem of selecting data from a large set, usually to find a smaller set of data that is representative of the entire set. Naturally, as problem sizes grow, these types of problems become intractable for classical computers. This means that even if we are able to find a solution to our problem, the time it takes us to do so will be too long, deeming the solution no longer useful to us.\n",

    "In Perceval, we use photons as our bosons (indistinguishable subatomic particles with an integer spin) to perform the task of boson sampling. Boson sampling is a quantum sampling problem, drawing from a big probability distribution of output states of a system. As our knowledge of the quantum world grows and quantum hardware becomes better, we hope to offer solutions to problems previously thought intractable."
